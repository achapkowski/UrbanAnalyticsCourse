    "Along with descriptive statistics and plots, obtaining correlation measures between variables is often very helpful in understanding the underlying patterns of our observations, selecting variables, and generally aid in the \"exploratory data analysis\" stage of our modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "While correlation gives us an idea on the level of association between two variables, it cannot be used to predict values, especially if more than one variable is involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose we are exploring insurance penetration in Phoenix, Arizona. Regression will help us identify how much insurance levels will change when i.e. employment rates also change. Simple linear regression is typically a function of the form:\n",
    "$$ y = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\varepsilon $$\n",
    "where $y$ is the variable we are trying to predict, called _dependent_ variable and $x$ is the variable that is used to make the prediction, called _independent_ variable. In a regression model, a dependent variable $y$ would thus be equal to $\\alpha$, which is a number called _intercept_, plus $\\beta$ times the independent variable $x$, which is called _coefficient_, plus the error term $\\varepsilon$. The latter is essential; within socio-economic phenomena it is extremely rare for one variable to completely predict another one without error, so value $\\varepsilon$ describes the error of our model.\n",
